# An Elm Single Page Application

An Elm single-page application with running examples from https://elm-lang.org/examples

The structure is mostly based on [Richard Feldman's single-page example](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/tree/master).

I wanted to try elm-native styling options, such as [elm-ui](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/).
